# Handmade Neural Network (MNIST)

This project is a simple neural network for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset in CSV format.

## Getting Started

1. Download the MNIST CSV dataset from Kaggle:
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv

2. Move the downloaded `mnist_train.csv` and `mnist_test.csv` files into the `data/` directory of this project.

That's it! You can now run and experiment with the code.

_This project is still in development._
