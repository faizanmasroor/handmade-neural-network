# Handmade Neural Network (MNIST Classifier)

This project is a simple neural network built from scratch to classify 28x28 pixel handwritten digits (MNIST dataset). It is intended for educational and development purposes.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Go to [Kaggle MNIST in CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv).
   - Download the dataset files.

2. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Move the `mnist_train.csv` and `mnist_test.csv` files into the `data` directory in this project.

3. **Install Requirements:**
   - Install dependencies with `conda install --file requirements.txt`.

## Notes
- This project is still in development.
- The neural network, data loading, and training are all implemented manually (no high-level ML frameworks).
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
